'''
You are given a sorted array consiting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once.

Return the single element that appear only once:
Your solution must run in O(logN) time and O(1) space

example 1:
input: nums = [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 8, 8]
output: 2

example 2:
input: nums = [3, 3, 7, 7, 10, 11, 11]
output: 10

the trick here is the runtime: O(logN)
