/*
Given a string a and an integer k, return the length of the longest substring of a that contains at most k distinct characters

Example 1:
Input: s = "eceba", k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:  The substring is "ece" with length 3

Example 2:
Input: s = "aa", k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation:  The substring is "aa" with length 2

Constraints:
- 1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10 ^ 4
- 0 <= k <= 50
I: string, k: number of distinct character
O: integer, the length of the longest substring
of a that contains at most k distinct characters
C:
E:  what if there is no solution?
example: s = "aa", k = 2
return 0?
Takeaways:
- need a hashMap of key/value: character: last seen position
- slide window.
- move the left pointer after deleting a character: left = leftMost + 1

Algo
-	return 0 if the string is empty or k is equal to zero
-	Set both pointers in the beginning of the string left = 0 and right = 0 and init max substring length max_len = 1
-	While right pointer is less than N:
o	Add the current character s[right] in the hashmap and move right pointer to the right.
o	If hashmap contains k + 1 distinct characters,
  - remove the left most character (the one have the smallest index) from the hashmap and move the left pointer so that sliding window contains again k distinct characters only
    - aka: left = leftMost + 1
o	Update max_len

/*
Runtime:  O(kN)
- need to find leftMost to delete
- can be improve if the hashMap is ordered.
Space: O(k)
- for hasMap
